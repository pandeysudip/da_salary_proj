Once tested and verified you will work with development teams to implement the algorithm as a scalable, hosted service.

We're looking for an experienced and creative data scientist who can conceptualize a project from start to finish, identifying the appropriate data and methodologies to use. Our Data Scientists work with open-source machine learning packages and libraries, so this position involves building custom ML/AI utilities from open-source resources in languages such as Python (preferred) and R. In this role, you will own and share technical solutions with both technical and non-technical stakeholders across multiple teams both internally and with external clients.

Responsibilities
Perform data analysis to understand the right combinations of data to meet outlined objectives
Translate client queries into actionable data pulls and help translate outputs into client strategies
Build and evaluate predictive modeling & machine learning utilities to produce meaningful outcomes that enable data-led decisions
Translate analysis results into actionable insights
Present insights to both technical and non-technical audiences
Partner with internal data scientists, developers, and tech teams to develop new methodologies and utilities
Work with development teams to implement data science algorithms as scalable, hosted services

Requirements
Background in math including linear algebra, statistics, probability, and numerical analysis.
Machine Learning Analysis: Must be able to execute, evaluate, and apply various models such as logistic regression, random forests/decision tree, nearest neighbor, neural net, support vector machine, an ensemble of multiple models, etc
Programming: Proficient coding in a language suited for machine learning systems such as Python or R (not reliant on GUI-based systems to execute analysis) for the purpose of cleaning, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data
Desired Skills
Experience with software engineering and developing deployable API services
Must be adaptable and have the drive to learn new technologies and frameworks to support developing client solutions
Using browser based interactive computational environments (like Jupyter Notebook) to perform analysis activities and test / evaluate data models and algorithms.
Tools: Spark, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL

We use technology, data, and design to:
Build more affordable products
Deliver them to more people
Engage through more human experiences
As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:
Languages: Python, Scala, and occasionally R and Node.js
Storage: Postgres, Redshift, S3
Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie
Nice to Have:
Familiarity with Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Looker, Superset
Domain experience developing software for Fintech, Banking, or related Consumer Financial Services companies
Earnest Perks & Benefits:
Health, Dental, & Vision benefits plus savings plans
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
